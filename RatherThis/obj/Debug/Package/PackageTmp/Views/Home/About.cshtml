<h2>ABOUT RATHERTHIS.COM</h2>
<p>
     Have you ever sat at your desk, cramming for that midterm exam, when halfway through the second page your mind suddenly asks, 
     "Would I rather..." Or maybe you’re the guy or girl who’s mindlessly facebooking or checking their email when your mind drones '_'.
      Irrelevant question? Maybe. Stupid? Definitely. Unimportant. Crazy. Embarrassing. But it’s there, in the back of your mind. 
      You wonder, would I rather live a short but exciting life or a long but boring life? 
      I wonder what other people think. But you let it go, you let the moment pass you by, 
      and you go back to facebook and that textbook you know you’re never going to get through by tomorrow morning. 
      

</p>
<br />
<p>But maybe that passing curiosity of yours can turn into something. </p>
